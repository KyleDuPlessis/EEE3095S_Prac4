While the Pi 3B+ does have an audio jack, it uses a purely PWM (pulse width modulation) based implementation for audio. Audiophiles among you may know that this is not a great way of playing audio. You can read more about the Raspberry Pi and itâ€™s audio jack here.
To improve audio quality, we can use a DAC (digital to analog converter).
